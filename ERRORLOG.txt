Currents Steps to get to problem
1. npm start - runs normally
2. sign in as admin - runs normally
3. attempt to go to profile page - errors on console:

```
ReferenceError: C:\Users\Kevin Kohls\BlocProjects\bloccit\src\views\users\show.ejs:67
```
<% const favorite = post.getFavoriteFor(currentUser.id) %>
<% if (favorite) { %>
```

    66|                 <!-- #4 -->
 >> 67|                 <% if(favorites) { %>
    68|                 <% favorites.forEach((favorite) => { %>
    69|
    70|                 <!-- #5 -->

favorites is not defined
```

**Latest debug steps**

Since favorites is not defined, we can look at the last place it has been defined successly - in `favorites\favoriting.ejs`. Here we see this .ejs:

```
<% const favorite = post.getFavoriteFor(currentUser.id) %>
<% if (favorite) { %>
```

We have tried several ways to move this definition into one of the files that will allow it to work, including the `\show.ejs\ file and other user and post files.  We have not found one that works at this time.
