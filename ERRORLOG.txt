Process basics working - Will need to do further tesing by adding more data, verifying tests, and checking profile functions

(Solved) All functions in running App appear to be function
- 67 of 74 spec fail, not allowing me to submit test. 
    - This be resolved before creating new testing code. 
        - The error appears to be caused by a lack of bloccit-test. 
            - Used pgAdmin to create bloccit-env db and reran - all 74 tests pass
            
** PUSH and SUBMIT on 3/15 at 1:30 PM

Will need to go back and correct one assignment problem.

PAST HISTORY is below:

All problems below solved. 
* "Nuclear Option" employeed - all previous versions of postgreSQL on Windows 10 deleted and a version was reinstalled. 

Current Problem
* Unable to render a single Topic page - <a> for a title does not lead to a page with a desciption, but displays `Not Found. Redirecting to /` on the Browser page. I am logged in as "Admin", not "Member"

* Manual attempt fails as well. 

Debug Resolution
* Step through from <a> through render to see where there is a failure -- Note, this error did not exist before the communication error and subsequent "nuclear option"

Worked with Michael Davis to solve the problem of the UserId column missing from the Post db. Creted a migration file and add column. Beginning testing of solution. 


Currents Steps to get to problem
1. npm start - runs normally
2. sign in (as admin or any other user) - program generates the errors below, and the following appears on the console. There are no errors on the web browser, and the app continues to parially run. You can get to every screen except Topics, including the sign in screen again. But any attempt to sign in creates the same errors below:

```
> bloccit@1.0.0 start C:\Users\Kevin Kohls\BlocProjects\bloccit
> node src/server.js

```    

This error is assumed to be an inability to launch postgres or connect through the seriver. 

There is a window admin for postgres on my computer. I can use it to connect or refresh the connection to postgres, and it accepts the password and appears to work, but any attempt to login is rejected. Any browser screens that attempt to access the db fail as well. Those that do not are find. 

**Latest debug steps  I have spend days working with many mentors and my own mentor drying to solve this problem. We have made some progress, but have failed to make the ultimate connection to this db. **

- We have done every version of pg_ctl I think exists;
- postgres -D /usr/local/pgsql/data
- pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres[VERSION NUMBER HERE] start
-  su postgres -p 5432  

I have pushed the latest version to GitHub -- the link is below.

I am left with a nuclear option that probably consists of adding another Server (or attempting to delete the server that I cannot get to) and recreating all of the datbases, which is certain to be a difficult process full of nasty, time-consuming problems. My mentor, Cory Trimm, would like to understand this problem better before we take that action. Here is feedback to the slack mentors:

Cory Trimm: Hey all, so just add some of my opinion based on the session I had with Kevin.

There are a handful of matters that need to be addressed.
1. He has 3 different installs of Postgres in 3 different folders.
2. For some reason there is no `data` directory inside of each of those Postgres installs (so, maybe there is no data in his DBs or no migrations were run?)
3. I'd prefer not to blow away the database and recreate it since we're unsure as to what the actual issue at hand is.

This is some speculation on my part and difficult for me to help debug since I haven't touched a Windows machine in 10+ years.


I will note that previous install problems had let to first installing version 11.1 for PostgreSQL, and then having an "a" and "b" version that used version 10. Version 11.1 in the original PostresSQL is the one that is being used, I believe, but I admit to some confusion on my part. 

If we can figure this out in a day or two, or this is not a issue that impacts my progress, I am all for figuring it out. I lost 3 days previously on postgres issues.
