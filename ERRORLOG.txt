Currents Steps to get to problem
1. npm start - runs normally
2. sign in as admin - runs normally
3. attempt to go to profile page - stays on the same page, with no errors on the console or the main page. 

Any manual attempt fails as well. 


**Latest debug steps**

The latest debug centered around working in src/db/queries.users.js, and moving the favorites location and cleaning it up as a function. 

I last worked with Jason Carpenter. His last feedback: 

So I pulled your latest changes to run your app and test it on my machine. And in creating your databases locally, I was able to run the migrations but not the seeds. It looks like your seeds is trying to use the `faker` npm package, but that is not listed in the package.json file so it doesn't get installed as a dependency.

I am not sure what to do about that feedback.
